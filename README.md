This is my version of the Markov Chains lab. It contains 5 files. 1 java file and 4 txt files. 3 of those files are training files: Alaska.txt, EuroPaper.txt, and Veidt.txt. The other is the output file for the AIs text. 
The word counts for each file is: Alaska.txt: 2744, EuroPaper: 2383, Veidt: 267.
